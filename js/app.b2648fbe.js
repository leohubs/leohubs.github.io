However, the conventional angular intra prediction directions, ranging from 45 degrees to -135 degrees in clockwise direction, were designed for square CUs. To better optimize the intra prediction for rectangular blocks, WAIP modes were proposed to enable intra prediction directions beyond the range of conventional intra prediction directions. For different aspect ratios of rectangular block shapes, different number of conventional angular intra prediction modes were replaced by WAIP modes. The replaced intra prediction modes are signaled using the original signaling method.

Generally, the univariate distributions of bandpass coefficients are used to fit a parametric probabilistic model and the model parameters serve as the quality-aware features. However, the inter-location, inter-direction and inter-scale correlations of natural images cannot be well exploited by such NSS models, as it is hard to capture such dependencies using univariate marginal distributions. In this paper, we build a novel NSS model of joint log-contrast distribution to take into account the across space and direction correlations of natural images (inter-scale correlation to be explored as the next step). Furthermore, we provide a new efficient approach to extract quality-aware features as the gradient of log-likelihood on the NSS model, instead of using model parameters directly. Finally, we develop an effective joint-NSS model based BIQA metric called BJLC (BIQA based on joint log-contrast statistics). Extensive experiments on four public large-scale image databases have validated that objective quality scores predicted by the proposed BIQA method are in higher accordance with subjective ratings generated by human observers compared with existing methods.",src:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218313432"},{id:"all-4-1",title:"Fast Adaptive Multiple Transform for Versatile Video Coding",author:"Zhaobin Zhang, Xin Zhao, Xiang Li, Zhu Li, Shan Liu",time:"2019",content:"The Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) recently launched the standardization of nextgeneration video coding named Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in which the Adaptive Multiple Transforms (AMT) is adopted as the primary residual coding transform solution.

For city-scale SfM point clouds with tens of millions of points, it becomes more and more difficult to disambiguate matches. Therefore a 3D Structure-based localization method, which can efficiently handle matches with very large outlier ratios, is needed. We propose a two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization that leverages both visibility and geometry intrinsics of SfM point clouds. Firstly, we propose a visibility-based outlier filter, which is based on a bipartite visibility graph, to filter outliers on a coarse level. Secondly, we apply a geometry-based outlier filter to generate a set of fine-grained matches with a novel data-driven geometrical constraint for efficient inlier evaluation. The proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework only relies on intrinsic information of a SfM point cloud. It is thus widely applicable to be embedded into existing localization approaches.

However, the highly dynamic characteristics of natural images will not always follow the first-order stationary Markov condition. It is well known that multi-core transforms and non-separable transforms capture diversified and directional texture patterns more efficiently. And a combination of enhanced multiple transform (EMT) and nonseparable secondary transform (NSST) are provided in the reference software of the next generation video coding standard to solve this problem. However, the current method of combining the EMT and NSST may lead to quite significant encoder complexity increase, which makes the video codec rather impractical for real applications. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the interactions between EMT and NSST, and propose a coupled primary and secondary transform to simplify the combination to obtain a better trade-off between the performance and the encoder complexity.

However, the inter-location, inter-direction and inter-scale correlations of natural images cannot be well exploited by such NSS models, as it is hard to capture such dependencies using univariate marginal distributions.

However, the conventional angular intra prediction directions, ranging from 45 degrees to -135 degrees in clockwise direction, were designed for square CUs. To better optimize the intra prediction for rectangular blocks, WAIP modes were proposed to enable intra prediction directions beyond the range of conventional intra prediction directions. For different aspect ratios of rectangular block shapes, different number of conventional angular intra prediction modes were replaced by WAIP modes. The replaced intra prediction modes are signaled using the original signaling method.

Generally, the univariate distributions of bandpass coefficients are used to fit a parametric probabilistic model and the model parameters serve as the quality-aware features. However, the inter-location, inter-direction and inter-scale correlations of natural images cannot be well exploited by such NSS models, as it is hard to capture such dependencies using univariate marginal distributions. In this paper, we build a novel NSS model of joint log-contrast distribution to take into account the across space and direction correlations of natural images (inter-scale correlation to be explored as the next step). Furthermore, we provide a new efficient approach to extract quality-aware features as the gradient of log-likelihood on the NSS model, instead of using model parameters directly. Finally, we develop an effective joint-NSS model based BIQA metric called BJLC (BIQA based on joint log-contrast statistics).

For city-scale SfM point clouds with tens of millions of points, it becomes more and more difficult to disambiguate matches. Therefore a 3D Structure-based localization method, which can efficiently handle matches with very large outlier ratios, is needed. We propose a two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization that leverages both visibility and geometry intrinsics of SfM point clouds. Firstly, we propose a visibility-based outlier filter, which is based on a bipartite visibility graph, to filter outliers on a coarse level. Secondly, we apply a geometry-based outlier filter to generate a set of fine-grained matches with a novel data-driven geometrical constraint for efficient inlier evaluation. The proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework only relies on intrinsic information of a SfM point cloud. It is thus widely applicable to be embedded into existing localization approaches.

However, the highly dynamic characteristics of natural images will not always follow the first-order stationary Markov condition. It is well known that multi-core transforms and non-separable transforms capture diversified and directional texture patterns more efficiently. And a combination of enhanced multiple transform (EMT) and nonseparable secondary transform (NSST) are provided in the reference software of the next generation video coding standard to solve this problem. However, the current method of combining the EMT and NSST may lead to quite significant encoder complexity increase, which makes the video codec rather impractical for real applications. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the interactions between EMT and NSST, and propose a coupled primary and secondary transform to simplify the combination to obtain a better trade-off between the performance and the encoder complexity.

Experiments on four benchmark data sets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-art methods.",src:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019309/"}]]],[[1,"dianYun"],[[{id:"dianYun-1-1",title:"A Two-stage Outlier Filtering Framework for City-Scale Localization using 3D SfM Point Clouds.",author:"Yabin Zhang, et al",time:"2019",content:"3D Structure-based localization aims to estimate the 6-DOF camera pose of a query image by means of feature matches against a 3D Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud. For city-scale SfM point clouds with tens of millions of points, it becomes more and more difficult to disambiguate matches. Therefore a 3D Structure-based localization method, which can efficiently handle matches with very large outlier ratios, is needed. We propose a two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization that leverages both visibility and geometry intrinsics of SfM point clouds. Firstly, we propose a visibility-based outlier filter, which is based on a bipartite visibility graph, to filter outliers on a coarse level. Secondly, we apply a geometry-based outlier filter to generate a set of fine-grained matches with a novel data-driven geometrical constraint for efficient inlier evaluation. The proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework only relies on intrinsic information of a SfM point cloud. It is thus widely applicable to be embedded into existing localization approaches. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization.",src:"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8704253"}]]]]},z={nav:{home:"Home",research:"Research",project:"Research Topics",solution:"Solutions",about:"About Us",join:"join"},homeLanguge:L,researchLanguge:G,projectLanguge:H,solutionLanguge:R,aboutLanguge:q},j=i("a925"),F=i("0e0b");function O(e,t){var i=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter(function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable})),i.push.apply(i,n)}return i}function B(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var i=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?O(i,!0).forEach(function(t){_(e,t,i[t])}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(i)):O(i).forEach(function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(i,t))})}return e}function _(e,t,i){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:i,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=i,e}var W=r["a"].prototype.push;r["a"].prototype.push=function(e){return W.call(this,e).catch(function(e){return e})},n["a"].use(a["a"]),n["a"].config.productionTip=!1,n["a"].component("Layout",A),c.beforeEach(function(e,t,i){i();var n=[{path:"/researchl",id:87517,eventName:"access_top_research"},{path:"/project",id:87516,eventName:"access_top_project"},{path:"/solution",id:87515,eventName:"access_top_solution"},{path:"/research/VideoUnderstanding",id:87514,eventName:"access_research_understanding"},{path:"/research/videoProcessing",id:87513,eventName:"access_research_process"},{path:"/research/audioTransmission",id:87511,eventName:"access_research_audio_and_video"},{path:"/projectTpg",id:87506,eventName:"access_project_TPG"},{path:"/projectTse",id:87505,eventName:"access_project_TSE"},{path:"/projectLiYing",id:87504,eventName:"access_project_liying"},{path:"/projectAudioAndVideo",id:87503,eventName:"access_project_platform"},{path:"/research/audioProcessing",id:87502,eventName:"access_research_audio"},{path:"/research/international",id:87501,eventName:"access_research_international"},{path:"/research/newMedia",id:87500,eventName:"access_research_immersive"},{path:"/research/videoCode",id:87499,eventName:"access_research_codec"},{path:"/research/perceptual",id:87498,eventName:"access_research_perceived"},{path:"/research/assessment",id:87497,eventName:"access_research_assess1"}];n.forEach(function(t){e.path===t.path&&Object(F["a"])(t.id,t.eventName)})}),n["a"].use(j["a"]);var U=new j["a"]({locale:"zh",messages:{zh:D,en:z}});c.afterEach(function(){window.scrollTo(0,0)});var J=new a["a"].Store(B({},w));new n["a"]({router:c,i18n:U,store:J,render:function(e){return e(o["default"])}}).$mount("#app")},"64a9":function(e,t,i){},ecc4:function(e,t,i){"use strict";var n=i("4d0e"),a=i.n(n);a.a}});
